            <p class="description">
                My name is Robert Tosic, and I am a computer scientist striving to be the best I can possibly be. Driven by a desire to continue to learn, I have explored through the various field in Computer Science and Technology with an open mind, ready to tackle anything that comes my way. On this website, I provide a basic description on skills and knowledge I possess, as well as showcasing some of the projects I created and worked on personally (including this very website).
                <br><br>
                I have taken courses and accumulated knowledge across a vast number of topics. I have created virtual reality applications, developed P2P (peer to peer) and client/server programs to establish these networks/connections, studied about various forms of encryption in order to personally create a light version of DES, among many other things. I have also delved into much of the theory of these topics, like the concepts behind the functionality of the internet, artifical intelligence and the functional calculus and the ideas that come with it, learning how the computer processes and creates geometry as it displays it on the screen, how machines and operating systems work, and so much more. 
                <br><br>
                As for skills that I have obtained, I am knowledgable and comfortable with C/C++/C#, SQL, Java, Python, Rust, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Perl/Django/PHP. I have developed applications with both OpenGL and Unity Game Engine. Along with the projects presented in detail below, I have also done a lot of front end and back end work with various small websites, creating search engines with linked databases, as well as using frameworks and libraries to help create a user friendly front end experience.
                <br><br>
                I currently work for the Bank of Montreal as a member of their IT Operations team. In this position, I have developed a deeper understanding on how servers work and interact with each other, as well as further cementing my knowledge on the fundemental theories and building blocks of computers. I mainly use AS/400 and IBM Mainframe in order to monitor the environment and manipulate the various servers and applications they house if need be.

                                Created in Unity and written in C#, this project provides the user a chance to hone their boxing skills in a controlled virtual reality environment. The user may opt to practice while hitting a punching bag, or, they have the chance to face a friend in local multiplayer.

                            Written in C, this project is a light recreation of the Data Encryption Standard, or DES for short. It allows the user to either encrypt or decrypt a message using different DES modes, and a key and number of rounds of the users choosing.
